# Enhancing-soil-carbon-with-trichoderma-a-hack-for-social-cause
Trichoderma fungi are a low-cost bio-hack for agriculture. They rapidly stabilize organic matter into humus, significantly boosting Soil Organic Carbon (SOC). This action directly tackles climate change (C-sequestration) and enhances food security by improving soil health and crop yields for smallholder farmers.
